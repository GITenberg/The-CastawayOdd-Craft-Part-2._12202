    THE CASTAWAY
</h2>
<p>
    Mrs. John Boxer stood at the door of the shop with her hands clasped on
    her apron.  The short day had drawn to a close, and the lamps in the
    narrow little thorough-fares of Shinglesea were already lit.  For a time
    she stood listening to the regular beat of the sea on the beach some
    half-mile distant, and then with a slight shiver stepped back into the
    shop and closed the door.

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    The little shop with its wide-mouthed bottles of sweets was one of her
    earliest memories.  Until her marriage she had known no other home, and
    when her husband was lost with the <i>North Star</i> some three years before,
    she gave up her home in Poplar and returned to assist her mother in the
    little shop.
</p>
<p>
    In a restless mood she took up a piece of needle-work, and a minute or
    two later put it down again.  A glance through the glass of the door
    leading into the small parlour revealed Mrs. Gimpson, with a red shawl
    round her shoulders, asleep in her easy-chair.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Boxer turned at the clang of the shop bell, and then, with a wild
    cry, stood gazing at the figure of a man standing in the door-way.  He
    was short and bearded, with oddly shaped shoulders, and a left leg which
    was not a match; but the next moment Mrs. Boxer was in his arms sobbing
    and laughing together.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson, whose nerves were still quivering owing to the suddenness
    with which she had been awakened, came into the shop; Mr. Boxer freed an
    arm, and placing it round her waist kissed her with some affection on the
    chin.
</p>
<p>
    "He's come back!"  cried Mrs. Boxer, hysterically.
</p>
<p>
    "Thank goodness," said Mrs. Gimpson, after a moment's deliberation.
</p>
<p>
    "He's alive!"  cried Mrs. Boxer.  "He's alive !"
</p>
<p>
    She half-dragged and half-led him into the small parlour, and thrusting
    him into the easy-chair lately vacated by Mrs. Gimpson seated herself
    upon his knee, regardless in her excitement that the rightful owner was
    with elaborate care selecting the most uncomfortable chair in the room.
</p>
<p>
    "Fancy his coming back!" said Mrs. Boxer, wiping her eyes.  "How did you
    escape, John?  Where have you been?  Tell us all about it."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer sighed.  "It 'ud be a long story if I had the gift of telling
    of it," he said, slowly, "but I'll cut it short for the present.  When
    the <i>North Star</i> went down in the South Pacific most o' the hands got
    away in the boats, but I was too late.  I got this crack on the head with
    something falling on it from aloft.  Look here."
</p>
<p>
    He bent his head, and Mrs. Boxer, separating the stubble with her
    fingers, uttered an exclamation of pity and alarm at the extent of the
    scar; Mrs. Gimpson, craning forward, uttered a sound which might mean
    anything&mdash;even pity.
</p>
<p>
    "When I come to my senses," continued Mr. Boxer, "the ship was sinking,
    and I just got to my feet when she went down and took me with her.  How I
    escaped I don't know.  I seemed to be choking and fighting for my breath
    for years, and then I found myself floating on the sea and clinging to a
    grating.  I clung to it all night, and next day I was picked up by a
    native who was paddling about in a canoe, and taken ashore to an island,
    where I lived for over two years.  It was right out o' the way o' craft,
    but at last I was picked up by a trading schooner named the <i>Pearl,</i>
    belonging to Sydney, and taken there.  At Sydney I shipped aboard the
    <i>Marston Towers,</i> a steamer, and landed at the Albert Docks this
    morning."
</p>
<p>
    "Poor John," said his wife, holding on to his arm.  "How you must have
    suffered!"
</p>
<p>
    "I did," said Mr. Boxer.  "Mother got a cold?"  he inquired, eying that
    lady.
</p>
<p>
    "No, I ain't," said Mrs. Gimpson, answering for herself.  "Why didn't you
    write when you got to Sydney?"
</p>
<p>
    "Didn't know where to write to," replied Mr. Boxer, staring.  "I didn't
    know where Mary had gone to."
</p>
<p>
    "You might ha' wrote here," said Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Didn't think of it at the time," said Mr. Boxer.  "One thing is, I was
    very busy at Sydney, looking for a ship.  However, I'm 'ere now."
</p>
<p>
    "I always felt you'd turn up some day," said Mrs. Gimpson.  "I felt
    certain of it in my own mind.  Mary made sure you was dead, but I said
    'no, I knew better.'"
</p>
<p>
    There was something in Mrs. Gimpson's manner of saying this that
    impressed her listeners unfavourably.  The impression was deepened when,
    after a short, dry laugh <i>a propos</i> of nothing, she sniffed again&mdash;three
    times.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, you turned out to be right," said Mr. Boxer, shortly.
</p>
<p>
    "I gin'rally am," was the reply; "there's very few people can take me
    in."
</p>
<p>
    She sniffed again.
</p>
<p>
    "Were the natives kind to you?" inquired Mrs. Boxer, hastily, as she
    turned to her husband.
</p>
<p>
    "Very kind," said the latter.  "Ah! you ought to have seen that island.
    Beautiful yellow sands and palm-trees; cocoa-nuts to be 'ad for the
    picking, and nothing to do all day but lay about in the sun and swim in
    the sea."
</p>
<p>
    "Any public-'ouses there?" inquired Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Cert'nly not," said her son-in-law.  "This was an island&mdash;one o' the
    little islands in the South Pacific Ocean."
</p>
<p>
    "What did you say the name o' the schooner was?"  inquired Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "<i>Pearl,</i>" replied Mr. Boxer, with the air of a resentful witness under
    cross-examination.
</p>
<p>
    "And what was the name o' the captin?"  said Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Thomas&mdash;Henery&mdash;Walter&mdash;Smith," said Mr. Boxer, with somewhat unpleasant
    emphasis.
</p>
<p>
    "An' the mate's name?"
</p>
<p>
    "John Brown," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
    "Common names," commented Mrs. Gimpson, "very common.  But I knew you'd
    come back all right&mdash;I never 'ad no alarm.  'He's safe and happy, my
    dear,' I says.  'He'll come back all in his own good time.'"
</p>
<p>
    "What d'you mean by that?" demanded the sensitive Mr. Boxer.  "I come
    back as soon as I could."
</p>
<p>
    "You know you were anxious, mother," interposed her daughter.  "Why, you
    insisted upon our going to see old Mr. Silver about it."
</p>
<p>
    "Ah!  but I wasn't uneasy or anxious afterwards," said Mrs. Gimpson,
    compressing her lips.
</p>
<p>
    "Who's old Mr. Silver, and what should he know about it?" inquired Mr.
    Boxer.
</p>
<p>
    "He's a fortune-teller," replied his wife.  "Reads the stars," said his
    mother-in-law.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer laughed&mdash;a good ringing laugh.  "What did he tell you?" he
    inquired.  "Nothing," said his wife, hastily.  "Ah!" said Mr. Boxer,
    waggishly, "that was wise of 'im.  Most of us could tell fortunes that
    way."
</p>
<p>
    "That's wrong," said Mrs. Gimpson to her daughter, sharply.  "Right's
    right any day, and truth's truth.  He said that he knew all about John
    and what he'd been doing, but he wouldn't tell us for fear of 'urting our
    feelings and making mischief."
</p>
<p>
    "Here, look 'ere," said Mr. Boxer, starting up; "I've 'ad about enough o'
    this.  Why don't you speak out what you mean?  I'll mischief 'im, the old
    humbug.  Old rascal."
</p>
<p>
    "Never mind, John," said his wife, laying her hand upon his arm.  "Here
    you are safe and sound, and as for old Mr. Silver, there's a lot o'
    people don't believe in him."
</p>
<p>
    "Ah! they don't want to," said Mrs. Gimpson, obstinately.  "But don't
    forget that he foretold my cough last winter."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, look 'ere," said Mr. Boxer, twisting his short, blunt nose into as
    near an imitation of a sneer as he could manage, "I've told you my story
    and I've got witnesses to prove it.  You can write to the master of the
    Marston Towers if you like, and other people besides.  Very well, then;
    let's go and see your precious old fortune-teller.  You needn't say who I
    am; say I'm a friend, and tell 'im never to mind about making mischief,
    but to say right out where I am and what I've been doing all this time.
    I have my 'opes it'll cure you of your superstitiousness."

<p>
    "We'll go round after we've shut up, mother," said Mrs. Boxer.  "We'll
    have a bit o' supper first and then start early."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson hesitated.  It is never pleasant to submit one's
    superstitions to the tests of the unbelieving, but after the attitude she
    had taken up she was extremely loath to allow her son-in-law a triumph.
</p>
<p>
    "Never mind, we'll say no more about it," she said, primly, "but I 'ave
    my own ideas."
</p>
<p>
    "I dessay," said Mr. Boxer; "but you're afraid for us to go to your old
    fortune-teller.  It would be too much of a show-up for 'im."
</p>
<p>
    "It's no good your trying to aggravate me, John Boxer, because you can't
    do it," said Mrs. Gimpson, in a voice trembling with passion.
</p>
<p>
    "O' course, if people like being deceived they must be," said Mr. Boxer;
    "we've all got to live, and if we'd all got our common sense fortune-
    tellers couldn't.  Does he tell fortunes by tea-leaves or by the colour
    of your eyes?"
</p>
<p>
    "Laugh away, John Boxer," said Mrs. Gimpson, icily; "but I shouldn't have
    been alive now if it hadn't ha' been for Mr. Silver's warnings."
</p>
<p>
    "Mother stayed in bed for the first ten days in July," explained Mrs.
    Boxer, "to avoid being bit by a mad dog."
</p>
<p>
    "Tchee&mdash;tchee&mdash;tchee," said the hapless Mr. Boxer, putting his hand over
    his mouth and making noble efforts to restrain himself; "tchee&mdash;tch
</p>
<p>
    "I s'pose you'd ha' laughed more if I 'ad been bit?"  said the glaring
    Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, who did the dog bite after all?"  inquired Mr. Boxer, recovering.
</p>
<p>
    "You don't understand," replied Mrs. Gimpson, pityingly; "me being safe
    up in bed and the door locked, there was no mad dog.  There was no use
    for it."
</p>
<p>
    "Well," said Mr. Boxer, "me and Mary's going round to see that old
    deceiver after supper, whether you come or not.  Mary shall tell 'im I'm
    a friend, and ask him to tell her everything about 'er husband.  Nobody
    knows me here, and Mary and me'll be affectionate like, and give 'im to
    understand we want to marry.  Then he won't mind making mischief."
</p>
<p>
    "You'd better leave well alone," said Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer shook his head.  "I was always one for a bit o' fun," he said,
    slowly.  "I want to see his face when he finds out who I am."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson made no reply; she was looking round for the market-basket,
    and having found it she left the reunited couple to keep house while she
    went out to obtain a supper which should, in her daughter's eyes, be
    worthy of the occasion.
</p>
<p>
    She went to the High Street first and made her purchases, and was on the
    way back again when, in response to a sudden impulse, as she passed the
    end of Crowner's Alley, she turned into that small by-way and knocked at
    the astrologer's door.
</p>
<p>
    A slow, dragging footstep was heard approaching in reply to the summons,
    and the astrologer, recognising his visitor as one of his most faithful
    and credulous clients, invited her to step inside.  Mrs. Gimpson
    complied, and, taking a chair, gazed at the venerable white beard and
    small, red-rimmed eyes of her host in some perplexity as to how to begin.
</p>
<p>
    "My daughter's coming round to see you presently," she said, at last.
</p>
<p>
    The astrologer nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "She&mdash;she wants to ask you about 'er husband," faltered' Mrs. Gimpson;
    "she's going to bring a friend with her&mdash;a man who doesn't believe in
    your knowledge.  He&mdash;he knows all about my daughter's husband, and he
    wants to see what you say you know about him."
</p>
<p>
    The old man put on a pair of huge horn spectacles and eyed her carefully.
</p>
<p>
    "You've got something on your mind," he said, at last; "you'd better tell
    me everything."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson shook her head.
</p>
<p>
    "There's some danger hanging over you," continued Mr. Silver, in a low,
    thrilling voice; "some danger in connection with your son-in-law.  There"
    he waved a lean, shrivelled hand backward and for-ward as though
    dispelling a fog, and peered into distance&mdash;"there is something forming
    over you.  You&mdash;or somebody&mdash;are hiding something from me."
</p>

<img src="008.jpg" height="695" width="544"
alt="'there is Something Forming over You.'
">
</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson, aghast at such omniscience, sank backward in her chair.
</p>
<p>
    "Speak," said the old man, gently; "there is no reason why you should be
    sacrificed for others."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson was of the same opinion, and in some haste she reeled off
    the events of the evening.  She had a good memory, and no detail was
    lost.
</p>
<p>
    "Strange, strange," said the venerable Mr. Silver, when he had finished.
    "He is an ingenious man."
</p>
<p>
    "Isn't it true?"  inquired his listener.  "He says he can prove it.  And
    he is going to find out what you meant by saying you were afraid of
    making mischief."
</p>
<p>
    "He can prove some of it," said the old man, his eyes snapping
    spitefully.  "I can guarantee that."
</p>
<p>
    "But it wouldn't have made mischief if you had told us that," ventured
    Mrs. Gimpson.  "A man can't help being cast away."
</p>
<p>
    "True," said the astrologer, slowly; "true.  But let them come and
    question me; and whatever you do, for your own sake don't let a soul know
    that you have been here.  If you do, the danger to yourself will be so
    terrible that even I may be unable to help you."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson shivered, and more than ever impressed by his marvellous
    powers made her way slowly home, where she found the unconscious Mr.
    Boxer relating his adventures again with much gusto to a married couple
    from next door.
</p>
<p>
    "It's a wonder he's alive," said Mr. Jem Thompson, looking up as the old
    woman entered the room; "it sounds like a story-book.  Show us that cut
    on your head again, mate."
</p>
<p>
    The obliging Mr. Boxer complied.
</p>
<p>
    "We're going on with 'em after they've 'ad sup-per," continued Mr.
    Thompson, as he and his wife rose to depart.  "It'll be a fair treat to
    me to see old Silver bowled out."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson sniffed and eyed his retreating figure disparagingly; Mrs.
    Boxer, prompted by her husband, began to set the table for supper.
</p>
<p>
    It was a lengthy meal, owing principally to Mr. Boxer, but it was over at
    last, and after that gentleman had assisted in shutting up the shop they
    joined the Thompsons, who were waiting outside, and set off for Crowner's
    Alley.  The way was enlivened by Mr. Boxer, who had thrills of horror
    every ten yards at the idea of the supernatural things he was about to
    witness, and by Mr. Thompson, who, not to be outdone, persisted in
    standing stock-still at frequent intervals until he had received the
    assurances of his giggling better-half that he would not be made to
    vanish in a cloud of smoke.
</p>
<p>
    By the time they reached Mr. Silver's abode the party had regained its
    decorum, and, except for a tremendous shudder on the part of Mr. Boxer as
    his gaze fell on a couple of skulls which decorated the magician's table,
    their behaviour left nothing to be desired.  Mrs. Gimpson, in a few
    awkward words, announced the occasion of their visit.  Mr. Boxer she
    introduced as a friend of the family from London.
</p>
<p>
    "I will do what I can," said the old man, slowly, as his visitors seated
    themselves, "but I can only tell you what I see.  If I do not see all, or
    see clearly, it cannot be helped."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer winked at Mr. Thompson, and received an understanding pinch in
    return; Mrs. Thompson in a hot whisper told them to behave themselves.
</p>
<p>
    The mystic preparations were soon complete.  A little cloud of smoke,
    through which the fierce red eyes of the astrologer peered keenly at Mr.
    Boxer, rose from the table.  Then he poured various liquids into a small
    china bowl and, holding up his hand to command silence, gazed steadfastly
    into it.  "I see pictures," he announced, in a deep voice.  "The docks of
    a great city; London.  I see an ill-shaped man with a bent left leg
    standing on the deck of a ship."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Thompson, his eyes wide open with surprise, jerked Mr. Boxer in the
    ribs, but Mr. Boxer, whose figure was a sore point with him, made no
    response.
</p>
<p>
    "The ship leaves the docks," continued Mr. Silver, still peering into the
    bowl.  "As she passes through the entrance her stern comes into view with
    the name painted on it.  The&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "Look agin, old chap," growled Mr. Boxer, in an undertone.
</p>
<p>
    "The North Star," said the astrologer.  "The ill-shaped man is still
    standing on the fore-part of the ship; I do not know his name or who he
    is.  He takes the portrait of a beautiful young woman from his pocket and
    gazes at it earnestly."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Boxer, who had no illusions on the subject of her personal
    appearance, sat up as though she had been stung; Mr. Thompson, who was
    about to nudge Mr. Boxer in the ribs again, thought better of it and
    assumed an air of uncompromising virtue.
</p>
<p>
    "The picture disappears," said Mr. Silver.  "Ah!  I see; I see.  A ship
    in a gale at sea.  It is the North Star; it is sinking.  The ill-shaped
    man sheds tears and loses his head.  I cannot discover the name of this
    man."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer, who had been several times on the point of interrupting,
    cleared his throat and endeavoured to look unconcerned.
</p>
<p>
    "The ship sinks," continued the astrologer, in thrilling tones.  "Ah!
    what is this?  a piece of wreck-age with a monkey clinging to it?  No,
    no-o.  The ill-shaped man again.  Dear me!"

<p>
    His listeners sat spellbound.  Only the laboured and intense breathing of
    Mr. Boxer broke the silence.
</p>
<p>
    "He is alone on the boundless sea," pursued the seer; "night falls.  Day
    breaks, and a canoe propelled by a slender and pretty but dusky maiden
    approaches the castaway.  She assists him into the canoe and his head
    sinks on her lap, as with vigorous strokes of her paddle she propels the
    canoe toward a small island fringed with palm trees."
</p>
<p>
    "Here, look 'ere&mdash;" began the overwrought Mr. Boxer.
</p>
<p>
    "H'sh, h'sh!"  ejaculated the keenly interested Mr. Thompson.  "W'y don't
    you keep quiet?"
</p>
<p>
    "The picture fades," continued the old man.  "I see another: a native
    wedding.  It is the dusky maiden and the man she rescued.  Ah! the
    wedding is interrupted; a young man, a native, breaks into the group.  He
    has a long knife in his hand.  He springs upon the ill-shaped man and
    wounds him in the head."
</p>
<p>
    Involuntarily Mr. Boxer's hand went up to his honourable scar, and the
    heads of the others swung round to gaze at it.  Mrs. Boxer's face was
    terrible in its expression, but Mrs. Gimpson's bore the look of sad and
    patient triumph of one who knew men and could not be surprised at
    anything they do.
</p>
<p>
    "The scene vanishes," resumed the monotonous voice, "and another one
    forms.  The same man stands on the deck of a small ship.  The name on
    the stern is the Peer&mdash;no, Paris&mdash;no, no, no, Pearl. It fades from the
    shore where the dusky maiden stands with hands stretched out
    imploringly.  The ill-shaped man smiles and takes the portrait of the
    young and beautiful girl from his pocket."
</p>
<p>
    "Look 'ere," said the infuriated Mr. Boxer, "I think we've 'ad about
    enough of this rubbish.  I have&mdash;more than enough."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't wonder at it," said his wife, trembling furiously.  "You can go
    if you like.  I'm going to stay and hear all that there is to hear."
</p>
<p>
    "You sit quiet," urged the intensely interested Mr. Thompson.  "He ain't
    said it's you.  There's more than one misshaped man in the world, I
    s'pose?"
</p>
<p>
    "I see an ocean liner," said the seer, who had appeared to be in a trance
    state during this colloquy.  "She is sailing for England from Australia.
    I see the name distinctly: the <i>Marston Towers</i>.  The same man is on
    board of her.  The ship arrives at London.  The scene closes; another one
    forms.  The ill-shaped man is sitting with a woman with a beautiful face
    &mdash;not the same as the photograph."
</p>
<p>
    "What they can see in him I can't think," muttered Mr. Thompson, in an
    envious whisper.  "He's a perfick terror, and to look at him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "They sit hand in hand," continued the astrologer, raising his voice.
    "She smiles up at him and gently strokes his head; he&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    A loud smack rang through the room and startled the entire company; Mrs.
    Boxer, unable to contain herself any longer, had, so far from profiting
    by the example, gone to the other extreme and slapped her husband's head
    with hearty good-will.  Mr. Boxer sprang raging to his feet, and in the
    confusion which ensued the fortune-teller, to the great regret of Mr.
    Thompson, upset the contents of the magic bowl.
</p>
<p>
    "I can see no more," he said, sinking hastily into his chair behind the
    table as Mr. Boxer advanced upon him.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson pushed her son-in-law aside, and laying a modest fee upon
    the table took her daughter's arm and led her out.  The Thompsons
    followed, and Mr. Boxer, after an irresolute glance in the direction of
    the ingenuous Mr. Silver, made his way after them and fell into the rear.
    The people in front walked on for some time in silence, and then the
    voice of the greatly impressed Mrs. Thompson was heard, to the effect
    that if there were only more fortune-tellers in the world there would be
    a lot more better men.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer trotted up to his wife's side.  "Look here, Mary," he began.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you speak to me," said his wife, drawing closer to her mother,
    "because I won't answer you."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer laughed, bitterly.  "This is a nice home-coming," he remarked.
</p>
<p>
    He fell to the rear again and walked along raging, his temper by no means
    being improved by observing that Mrs. Thompson, doubtless with a firm
    belief in the saying that "Evil communications corrupt good manners,"
    kept a tight hold of her husband's arm.  His position as an outcast was
    clearly defined, and he ground his teeth with rage as he observed the
    virtuous uprightness of Mrs. Gimpson's back.  By the time they reached
    home he was in a spirit of mad recklessness far in advance of the
    character given him by the astrologer.
</p>
<p>
    His wife gazed at him with a look of such strong interrogation as he was
    about to follow her into the house that he paused with his foot on the
    step and eyed her dumbly.
</p>
<p>
    "Have you left anything inside that you want?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
    Mr. Boxer shook his head.  "I only wanted to come in and make a clean
    breast of it," he said, in a curious voice; "then I'll go."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson stood aside to let him pass, and Mr. Thompson, not to be
    denied, followed close behind with his faintly protesting wife.  They sat
    down in a row against the wall, and Mr. Boxer, sitting opposite in a
    hang-dog fashion, eyed them with scornful wrath.
</p>
<p>
    "Well?"  said Mrs. Boxer, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "All that he said was quite true," said her husband, defiantly.  "The
    only thing is, he didn't tell the arf of it.  Altogether, I married three
    dusky maidens."
</p>
<p>
    Everybody but Mr. Thompson shuddered with horror.
</p>
<p>
    "Then I married a white girl in Australia," pursued Mr. Boxer, musingly.
    "I wonder old Silver didn't see that in the bowl; not arf a fortune-
    teller, I call 'im."
</p>
<p>
    "What they see in 'im!" whispered the astounded Mr. Thompson to his wife.
</p>
<p>
    "And did you marry the beautiful girl in the photograph?" demanded Mrs.
    Boxer, in trembling accents.
</p>
<p>
    "I did," said her husband.
</p>
<p>
    "Hussy," cried Mrs. Boxer.
</p>
<p>
    "I married her," said Mr. Boxer, considering&mdash;"I married her at
    Camberwell, in eighteen ninety-three."
</p>
<p>
    "Eighteen ninety-three!" said his wife, in a startled voice.  "But you
    couldn't.  Why, you didn't marry me till eighteen ninety-four."
</p>
<p>
    "What's that got to do with it?" inquired the monster, calmly.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Boxer, pale as ashes, rose from her seat and stood gazing at him
    with horror-struck eyes, trying in vain to speak.
</p>
<p>
    "You villain!" cried Mrs. Gimpson, violently.  "I always distrusted you."

<p>
    "I know you did," said Mr. Boxer, calmly.  "You've been committing
    bigamy," cried Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Over and over agin," assented Mr. Boxer, cheerfully.  "It's got to be a
    'obby with me."
</p>
<p>
    "Was the first wife alive when you married my daughter?" demanded Mrs.
    Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Alive?" said Mr. Boxer.  "O' course she was.  She's alive now&mdash;bless
    her."
</p>
<p>
    He leaned back in his chair and regarded with intense satisfaction the
    horrified faces of the group in front.
</p>
<p>
    "You&mdash;you'll go to jail for this," cried Mrs. Gimpson, breathlessly.
    "What is your first wife's address?"
</p>
<p>
    "I decline to answer that question," said her son-in-law.
</p>
<p>
    "What is your first wife's address?"  repeated Mrs. Gimpson.
</p>
<p>
    "Ask the fortune-teller," said Mr. Boxer, with an aggravating smile.
    "And then get 'im up in the box as a witness, little bowl and all.  He
    can tell you more than I can."
</p>
<p>
    "I demand to know her name and address," cried Mrs. Gimpson, putting a
    bony arm around the waist of the trembling Mrs. Boxer.
</p>
<p>
    "I decline to give it," said Mr. Boxer, with great relish.  "It ain't
    likely I'm going to give myself away like that; besides, it's agin the
    law for a man to criminate himself.  You go on and start your bigamy
    case, and call old red-eyes as a witness."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Gimpson gazed at him in speechless wrath and then stooping down
    conversed in excited whispers with Mrs. Thompson.  Mrs. Boxer crossed
    over to her husband.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, John," she wailed, "say it isn't true, say it isn't true."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer hesitated.  "What's the good o' me saying anything?"  he said,
    doggedly.
</p>
<p>
    "It isn't true," persisted his wife.  "Say it isn't true."
</p>
<p>
    "What I told you when I first came in this evening was quite true," said
    her husband, slowly.  "And what I've just told you is as true as what
    that lying old fortune-teller told you.  You can please yourself what you
    believe."
</p>
<p>
    "I believe you, John," said his wife, humbly.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Boxer's countenance cleared and he drew her on to his knee.
</p>
<p>
    "That's right," he said, cheerfully.  "So long as you believe in me I
    don't care what other people think.  And before I'm much older I'll find
    out how that old rascal got to know the names of the ships I was aboard.
    Seems to me somebody's been talking."

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
